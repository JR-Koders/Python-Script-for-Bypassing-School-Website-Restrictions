# Python-Script-for-Bypassing-School-Website-Restrictions"

Are you tired of navigating the maze of website restrictions imposed by your school's network?

**Introducing the Web Unblocker**, a Python script designed to help you seamlessly access blocked content without the hassle.

### The way it works
This script takes a user-provided query, *performs a Google search*, and *systematically tests each URL from the results* until it discovers an **unblocked link**.

__NOTE__ My script is adapted to the MCCSC policy blocking, and the specific webpage associated to it. If you want to change the script according to your specific situation, just change the `checkIfUrlBlocked()` function.

Because I coded the script using the _very good request library_, I ensure that it will stay working and efficient for the more time possible

By automating the process, the Web Unblocker allows users to swiftly find accessible content, making it a handy tool for students and individuals navigating restrictive online environments.

**NOTE** Use it responsibly and in compliance with your school's policies, don't use it for anything illegal!
